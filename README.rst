About
--------

This is a web application designed to provide real time information for the availability of bikes at the stations
around Dublin city. The user can see a map of all the stations as well as viewing the amount of bikes/stands available
at each one. Weather information and average occupancy is also available to assist the user in planning a journey for
a certain time of day.
